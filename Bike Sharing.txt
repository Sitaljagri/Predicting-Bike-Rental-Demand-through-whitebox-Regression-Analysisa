Project Description:

Dataset Information:

Bike sharing systems have become a popular mode of urban transportation, offering a convenient and environmentally friendly way for users to rent bikes. This project focuses on a dataset related to a bike sharing system, which records various attributes related to bike rentals, such as date, time, weather conditions, and user type.

The dataset consists of the following attributes:

instant: Record index
dteday: Date
season: Season (1: winter, 2: spring, 3: summer, 4: fall)
yr: Year (0: 2011, 1: 2012)
mnth: Month (1 to 12)
hr: Hour (0 to 23)
holiday: Indicates whether it's a holiday or not
weekday: Day of the week
workingday: 1 if it's a working day, 0 otherwise
weather: Weather situation (1: clear, 2: mist, 3: light rain/snow, 4: heavy rain/snow)
temp: Normalized temperature in Celsius
atemp: Normalized feeling temperature in Celsius
humidity: Normalized humidity
windspeed: Normalized wind speed
casual: Count of casual users
registered: Count of registered users
count: Count of total rental bikes (casual + registered)
Project Tasks:

Data Loading and Preprocessing: Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame, check for missing values, and perform necessary data preprocessing, including renaming columns, changing data types, and encoding categorical variables.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct EDA to gain insights into the dataset. Create visualizations to explore how bike rental counts vary with different factors such as time of day, day of the week, weather conditions, and more.

Data Transformation: Transform the target variable count using a logarithmic transformation to make it more suitable for regression modeling.

Feature Engineering: Perform feature engineering by one-hot encoding categorical variables and preparing the data for model training.

Model Selection: Train and evaluate multiple regression models using cross-validation to predict bike rental counts. Consider models like Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Huber Regressor, Elastic Net, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, Extra Trees Regressor, and Gradient Boosting Regressor.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the selected model's performance using root mean squared error (RMSE) on the test dataset to assess how well it predicts bike rental counts.

Error Analysis: Analyze the prediction errors to understand the model's shortcomings and identify areas for potential improvement.

Conclusion and Recommendations: Summarize the findings and provide recommendations for improving the bike sharing system or optimizing bike availability based on the model's insights.

Documentation and Reporting: Create a comprehensive report or presentation that outlines the entire project, including data preprocessing, EDA, model selection, evaluation, and recommendations.

This project aims to provide valuable insights into bike sharing demand prediction, helping stakeholders make informed decisions to enhance the efficiency and accessibility of the bike sharing system.
